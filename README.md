This program is a simple calculator made in Android Studio that has the following operators:
  1. Addition (+)
  2. Subtraction (-)
  3. Multiplication (*)
  4. Division (\) 
  5. Percentage (%)
  6. All Clear (AC)
  7. Delete (<-)
  
This program supports double values and negative values, however, does not have a operator that changes the sign of a number. 
Other than that, it works like a normal calculator. The percentage operator, takes a value and then divides by 100. The number
has to have been already put in, and then the operator must be pressed in order to get a result. 

This program returns invalid if there are any values or operator mix ups on the screen. In order to reset, the All Clear button
must be pressed.
